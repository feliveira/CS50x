# :money_with_wings: C T R L - CS50x Final Project
A web application created to make finance management easier.  
Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Flask and SQL

## Requirements

To make the project fully functional you will need to have installed all of the dependencies that it needs, to do so you will need to type the following command in the terminal of your IDE

```
pip install 
```
Before pressing enter, type one of the dependencies name and then press enter to download it, repeat it until you have all of them, the dependencies are:

```
py3-validate-email  
flask  
flask_session  
werkzeug  

```
The last one is a little different, you will need to download it from its own website

[sqlite3](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html)

after installing everything, just type **flask run** in the terminal and you will be ready to go! :smile:
